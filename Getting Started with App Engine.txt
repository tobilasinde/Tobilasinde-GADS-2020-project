LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

Overview
In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.
Objectives
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
•	Initialize App Engine.
•	Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
•	Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
•	Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.
STEPS
1.	Initializing your app engine
- To display your project ID, enter this command:
gcloud config list project

The output should look like this:

[core] project = qwiklabs-gcp-44776a13dea667a6


- Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located.


- Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

- Navigate to the source directory:

cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world


2.	Run Hello World application locally

- Execute the following command to download and update the packages list:

sudo apt-get update


- Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

sudo apt-get install virtualenv

If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

virtualenv -p python3 venv

- Activate the virtual environment.

source venv/bin/activate
- Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the application:
python main.py
Please ignore the warning if any.
- View the app on a new tab on the specified port 8080

3.	Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine

- Navigate to the source directory:

   cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

- Deploy your Hello World application.
   gcloud app deploy
   If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
   This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration
- Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
    gcloud app browse
    Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window. You should see HELLO WORLD.

4.	Disable the application
   App Engine offers no option to Undeploy an application. After an application is deployed, it remains deployed, although you could instead replace the application with a simple page that says something like "not in service."
 However, you can disable the application, which causes it to no longer be accessible to users.
- Disable the application:
gcloud app disable
